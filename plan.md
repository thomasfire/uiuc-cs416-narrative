The overall story - it should tell a story of decline of HK domestic property 
market and find the opportunity in it. 
Need to bind the story with the data:
* economically active households monthly income, grouped by household size in persons
* monthly rents for each year
* sales prices for each year
* population per district (?) - probably not needed
* best lending rate for each year
* classes description

So, it can have following scenes:

##  Scene 1 â€” Strugles of those who rent

This scene should tell the story of those who rent.
We can just show a chart with monthly rents for each year,
where there is somewhat steady rise of the rents.
I think similar to dashboard, it should be a linechart.
Highlight major events - covid, protests, other crysises.

## Scene 2 - Hope for buying home

Show a linechart with sales prices for each year.
They show recent drop  in prices.
In popover can show price to rent ratio in year.
Highlight major events - covid, protests, other crysises.

## Scene 3 - More home - interest rates

Show a linechart of best lending rate for each year - and 
denote that it is not actual mortgage rate.
In highlights can show protests and covid (both shut downs and lifting restrictions)

## Scene 4 - Crash into reality - not much people can afford

Here show a chart with monthly income, grouped by household size.
In popovers also show the income to sales prices ratio.
Also highlight that it may be an opportunity for those who can afford it.

## Scene 5 - Free dashboard, that combines all the data

* 1997 - handover, Asian Financial Crisis
